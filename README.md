# Netflix Data Warehousing and Analysis
*	Implemented a Python based Lambda function to be triggered on creation of a csv file in S3 bucket, processing 5 files/day
*	Leveraged the Lambda function code and Azure Data Factory to pre-process, clean, standardize, and transform csv data to a suitable JSON format and load it into Cosmos DB (NoSQL API) and Graph DB (Gremlin API)
* Visualized the Cosmos DB Document data using PowerBI dashboard containing treemap, pie chart, time-series graph depicting gradual increase in Netflix Movie and TV Shows content and the effects of Covid-19 on the on-going trend


**Below is the screenshot of the final dashboard**
